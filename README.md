This project is all about making inventory management and sales forecasting less of a headache for e-commerce businesses. By using Azure’s data tools and following the Medallion Architecture, I set up a data pipeline that takes raw sales data and turns it into actionable insights you can actually use.

What It Does:

Data Pipeline: Built a solid pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Data Lake Storage to handle the flow of data from start to finish.
Organized Data Layers: Split data into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to keep things clean and make analysis smoother.
Sales Reports: Pulled together daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly sales data, plus top-selling products, to help with planning.
Power BI Dashboards: Created interactive dashboards so you can easily see what’s going on with your sales and inventory.

Why It Matters:

Helps make smarter decisions by giving you accurate sales forecasts and better control over inventory.
Cuts down on costs by keeping stock levels in check and avoiding the usual pitfalls like overstocking or running out of popular items.
The whole setup is built on Azure, so it’s scalable and won’t break the bank as your data grows.

This project is a practical guide for anyone looking to build a data-driven solution that actually works in the real world.
